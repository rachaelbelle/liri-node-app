# LIRI Bot

### Overview

This is LIRI. LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a _Language_ Interpretation and Recognition Interface.

### Welcome

LIRI can search Spotify for songs, Bands in Town for concerts, and OMDB for movies.

She send requests using the `axios` package to the Bands in Town, Spotify and OMDB APIs. You'll find these Node packages crucial for your assignment.

To test my app, please install the dependencies found in my package.JSON.  (I have git ignored my Node Modules)
